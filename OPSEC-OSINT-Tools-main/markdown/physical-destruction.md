  💪 Renders platters unreadable

- **Degaussing**  
  Powerful magnetic field scrambles data and destroys formatting  
  🧲 Makes drive completely unusable

## At-Home/Manual Methods

- **Drilling**  
  Remove HDD and drill multiple holes through casing and platters  
  🔩 Physically damages platters

- **Hammering**  
  Use hammer and nail/ice pick to puncture or shatter platters  
  🔨 Focus on making deep dents

- **Disassembly & Scratching**  
  Open casing, remove platters, and scratch/shatter them  
  🛠️ Use screwdriver, sandpaper, or pliers

## Other Methods

- **Incineration**  
  Industrial furnace melts platters  
  ☢️ Professional only (toxic fumes)

- **Crushing/Milling**  
  Heavy-duty presses pulverize drive  
  ⚙️ Industrial equipment required

# Methods to Physically Destroy an SSD

## Overview
Physically destroying a solid-state drive (SSD) is the most reliable way to ensure that data cannot be recovered. Unlike hard disk drives (HDDs), SSDs store data on multiple flash memory chips, so destruction must target these chips specifically.

## At-Home Methods

- **Disassemble the SSD**
  - Open the SSD casing using a screwdriver or prying tool to expose the circuit board and memory chips
- **Destroy the Memory Chips**
  - Use a hammer and cold chisel to split each memory chip in half (focus on the largest chips)
  - Alternative tools: drill (bore through chips) or Dremel with cutting disk (grind through chips)
  - Ensure all chips on both sides of the board are destroyed
- **Dispose Responsibly**
  - Collect the remains and take them to a certified e-waste recycler

## Industrial/Professional Methods

- **Shredding**
  - Specialized shredders reduce SSD to tiny pieces (preferred for businesses/high-security)
- **Incineration**
  - Requires furnace rated at 1,600°C+ (DoD/NSA approved, professionals only)
- **Disintegrators**
  - Machines that pulverize SSDs to fine particles (highest security standards)

## Methods to Avoid

- ❌ **Degaussing** - Ineffective (SSDs don't store data magnetically)
- ❌ **Acid Baths** - Effective but dangerously hazardous
- ❌ **Superficial Damage** - Must destroy all memory chips thoroughly

## Quick Reference Table

| Method              | Effectiveness | Tools Needed         | Safety/Environmental Notes         |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Hammer/Chisel       | High         | Hammer, chisel       | Wear eye protection; recycle waste |
| Drill/Dremel        | High         | Drill/Dremel         | Wear protection; recycle waste     |
| Shredder            | Very High    | Industrial shredder  | Professional service recommended   |
| Incineration        | Very High    | Industrial furnace   | Only by professionals; hazardous   |
| Acid Bath           | High         | Hazardous chemicals  | Not recommended; dangerous         |
| Degaussing          | Ineffective  | Degaussing machine   | Not applicable to SSDs             |

## Summary

To physically destroy an SSD:
1. Open the drive and destroy all memory chips (hammer/chisel/drill/Dremel)
2. For higher security: use professional shredding/incineration services
3. Always dispose at certified e-waste facilities

These methods ensure data cannot be recovered by conventional means.

## NVMe (Solid-State) Drives

**Description:**
NVMe drives are a type of solid-state storage that use NAND flash memory and are increasingly common in modern laptops and desktops. Unlike hard drives, they do not use magnetic platters and require different destruction methods.

**Effective Destruction Methods:**

* **Shredding:** Use an industrial shredder capable of reducing the entire drive (including chips) to particles ≤2 mm. This is the gold standard for SSD destruction.
* **Pulverizing or Incinerating:** Complete destruction of all chips and components renders data recovery impossible.
* **Direct Chip Destruction:** For manual/home approaches, physically destroy all NAND flash chips using a hammer, drill, or pliers. Focus on the black rectangular chips on the PCB, not just the board itself.
* **Cryptographic Erasure (Optional):** If supported, perform a secure erase before physical destruction for added assurance.

**Home User Destruction Guidance:**

1. Remove the NVMe drive from your device.
2. Identify all NAND chips on the PCB.
3. Use a hammer, pliers, or drill to crush, chip, or shred the memory chips until they are completely destroyed.
4. Avoid relying on software erasure alone for sensitive data.
5. If no tools are available, seek local e-waste or destruction services that accept SSDs.

## Ineffective Methods for NVMe Drives

These methods do **not** reliably destroy data on NVMe or SSD drives:

* **Degaussing:** NVMe drives do not store data magnetically; degaussing has no effect.
* **Random Drilling:** A few holes may miss some chips. Only effective if all chips are directly destroyed.
* **Submersion in Water:** Water does not damage NAND flash storage. Drives may work again after drying.
* **Microwaving:** Dangerous and not guaranteed to destroy all chips. Also a fire hazard.
* **Magnets:** Have no impact on solid-state memory.

***Other Medias***

"Physically destroying a device is the most reliable way to keep others from recovering its data, and this should only be done if the device will not be reused by someone else. Professional services or careful do‑it‑yourself methods, such as puncturing or shredding drives and discs into extremely small pieces, can render information unrecoverable. Magnetic media can also be erased with powerful magnets, but this process is usually too expensive for individuals and permanently disables the device’s internal operating components, making it unsuitable if the device will be passed on."(Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency pg. 2–3)[^1]
